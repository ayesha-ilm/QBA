# Quantitative Bias Analysis in Finance

## Overview

This project explores **Quantitative Bias Analysis (QBA)** in financial data. QBA is used to assess and correct biases in observed financial metrics, such as stock returns or asset prices. This implementation demonstrates how bias can be introduced in financial returns and applies correction techniques to estimate true values.

## Methodology

- **Simulated Financial Data**: Generated using a normal distribution for true returns.
- **Bias Introduction**: Introduced using random multipliers to simulate observational errors.
- **Bias Correction**: Applied QBA to adjust for known bias factors and estimate unbiased returns.
- **Visualization**: Compares true, observed, and bias-adjusted returns.

The script will output:

- A **graph** showing true, observed, and corrected returns.
- A **summary table** with bias corrections applied.
